# decentralized-voting-system

A decentralized voting system where a user can walk into a government authorized center (Ex- banks, telecom companies etc.) and cast their vote using the proposed portal.

 - **No VoterID required** as a user's validity (age: 18+) is determined dynamically using the Aadhaar API 
 - **Secure vote** by Azure blockchain and biometric authentication (using pre-existing Aadhaar database)
 - **Shorter wait times** as it is decentralized
 - Portal **front end** can provide useful information on the candidate and **can aid in their decision making** (display promises, proposals etc.)

## Technologies

 - Azure Blockchain
 - Python (to communicate with blockchain and for backend and frontend API calls) 
 - Truffle (provides tools to create and test smart contracts)
 - Ganache (to create private blockchain network for testing on localhost) 
 - Flask (web framework)
